For the Content Based Filtering implementation, the steps are as follows:

## Loading the .ipynb file

* Step 1: Download and open the Content_Filtering_Concise.ipynb file
* Step 2: Use Colab to open the ipynb file
* Step 3: Upload the book_summaries_genres.csv dataset file to google drive and mount in Colab
* Step 4: Access the dataset "book_summaries_genres.csv" using drive from the link https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e8wIDOVVH5Nh2_E9vA9lNN3-9J45hQ9B/view?usp=sharing
* Step 5: Run cells in sequence, the functions outline the different methods we used, such as CountVectorizer, TF_IDF, WORD2VEC, etc

For the simple Collaborative Filtering implementation, the steps are as follows:

## LOADING THE .ipynb FILE
* Step 1: Download and open Simple_Base_Collaborative.ipynb file

## LOADING THE DATASET AND THE MODELS
* Step 2: Download the TrainRatings3.csv and TestRatings3.csv
* Step 3: Upload the abovementioned csv files
* Step 4: Access the datasets "TrainRatings3.csv" and "TestRatings3.csv" using drive from the link https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wKwgtAQ2Vwx9vRr0xRJaGU6wR2New39i?usp=sharing
* Step 4: Run

Here, we have implemented a Hybrid Book Recommendation Model using a Content-Based Model and a Collaborative Model. Plus the extra implementations of the KKN and SVD based models are added here. The steps to run the hybrid model are as follows-

## LOADING THE .ipynb FILE
* Step 1: Download and open the SML_Final_Project.ipynb file
## LOADING THE DATASET AND THE MODELS
* Step 2: Access the datasets "Books.csv", "Ratings.csv", "Users.csv" from the link https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-iFuR2D6OjHo0wgmh5-ngZkf43amJTgm?usp=sharing
* Step 3: Access the datasets "merged_file.csv" and "final_intersection_dataset.csv" from the link https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wKwgtAQ2Vwx9vRr0xRJaGU6wR2New39i?usp=sharing
* Step 4: Run
